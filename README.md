How to use with skateboard:

- For some reason you need exactly this compiler: **gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_4-2016q3**
- On any newer gcc version, the board does not boot after flashing !?
- Adjust path in **TOOLCHAIN** variable in **toolchain.mak** file
- The board works correctly if the green LED lights up. When receiving data over UART
  the LED flashes blue.

- Compile code:

<code>
  make -f stm32f303/Makefile
</code>

- Bridge pins for DFU mode while plugging in USB cable
- Flash by using the following command:

<code>
  sudo dfu-util -d 0483:df11 -a 0 -s 0x8000000:leave -D obj_hvf3/hvf3.bin
</code>

You meight also adjust some stuff in main.c (PID controller params etc.)
